# Create a More Sustainable World: A Comprehensive Measurement Model of Sustainability


## Introduction

This project is done for **Problem D** in **Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)** in 2015.  We won finalist in the contest.

## Summary

Basically, in this paper, we develop a mathematical model to assess the degree of sustainability of different countries
and attempt to put forward a 20 year sustainable development plan for the selected Least Developed Country. In addition, we give a methodology to simulate and evaluate the influence of the 20-year sustainability plan and extend this model to more real conditions when additional environmental factors are taken into consideration.

The model is based on **Comprehensive Evaluation Model**, **Principal Component Analysis** and **linear fitting method**.

The data were mostly from [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org).

The codes were written using **Matlab**.
